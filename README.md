# TourOfHeroes
This is an official project of AngularTrainingProgram. The official website of Angular recommeds this project in order to get intermediate level of understanding and familiarity. However, the project lacks dynamicity as it does not have anything to support in backend and thus doesn't qualify as fullstack. In my version i've used springBoot in order to provide the model for Heroes and also controller to control and link the model to the database(here MYSQL) thus allowing the tourOfHeroes to qualify as a full stack project. You can update and add a new hero dynamically in the frontend and that will be persisted in the dataBase. Overall its a fun project to play around and get intermediate level of expertise in both springBoot and Angular.
